# incident-medical-card
A web application that allows for quick and correct replenishment of victim cards for search and rescue groups, medical teams and paramedics.


I have seen a few similar applications but none of them had what it needs, they were too complex, they contained too many things that made it difficult to work instead of making it easier. This application will be trivial on the device, accurate and most convenient for everyone. The entire application is created for me as a private person and for every rescuer in the world!
